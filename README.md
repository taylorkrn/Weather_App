# Weather Condition and Forecast for Berlin (Javascript/Jquery)

## Using data gained from the Web API: https://www.weatherapi.com/

Upon the clicking of the buttons *Get Weather* and *Get Forecast* are respectively the current weather and 3 day forecast for Berlin retrieved from weatherapi and displayed.
- The buttons have responsive display to being hovered over and clicked.
- The time in the top right corner is updated every 5 seconds

Through this project I learnt the basics of JQuery and used this to connect with a public API, retrieving and displaying Weather Data. Through this project I also adapted and developed my css/html skillbase, including *@media screen* specifications.
